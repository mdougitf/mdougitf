## Hi there 👋

💻 My Interests in Tech
I’ve been diving into coding recently and enjoy learning new programming languages, building small projects, and exploring how technology can solve real-world problems. My goal is to eventually work in a field where I can combine my love for science, coding, and innovation.
Some areas I'm exploring:
- Python 🐍
- Web development 🌐
- Robotics 🤖
- Data science 📊

🏀 Outside the Lab
When I’m not studying or coding, you’ll probably find me:
Playing basketball – I love the strategy, teamwork, and energy of the game.
Taking photographs – Capturing moments, people, and nature through a lens is one of my favorite creative outlets.
Listening to music, reading, and spending time with friends.

📚 Always Learning
I believe that learning never stops. I'm always searching for new tutorials, online courses, and open-source projects to contribute to or learn from. GitHub is a big part of that journey.

🚀 Looking Ahead
I'm excited about the future and all the possibilities in science and technology. Whether it’s building apps, contributing to open source, or researching new ideas—I’m ready to learn and grow.
